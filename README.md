# JS Machine
## A 16-Bit Virtual Machine written in JavaScript

I attempted to create a powerful virtual machine in JavaScript with the following features:

- A flexible, extensible, register-based virtual machine
- Support for signed, unsigned and floating point operations
- A call stack 
- Interrupt capabilities
- Ability to do memory mapping for IO
- An assembly language with macro and module support
- A higher level, C like language. We'll use and expand the library from the parser combinators from scratch series
- And finally, to be able to take the whole thing into the browser and exend it to create a sort of fantasy console - an emulator for a machine that never existed

I was only able to complete the creation of a register-based virtual machine, but did not get farther after that. This project is 15% finished and I will likely not finish it because low-level JS is not a lot of fun for me.
