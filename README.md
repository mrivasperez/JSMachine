# JS Machine
## A 16-Bit Virtual Machine written in JavaScript

This project has been the most fun for me! I created a powerful virtual machine in JavaScript with the following features:


- A flexible, extensible, register-based virtual machine
- Support for signed, unsigned and floating point operations
- A call stack 
- Interrupt capabilities
- Ability to do memory mapping for IO
- An assembly language with macro and module support
- A higher level, C like language. We'll use and expand the library from the parser combinators from scratch series
- And finally, to be able to take the whole thing into the browser and exend it to create a sort of fantasy console - an emulator for a machine that never existed
